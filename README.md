Amazon Clone for front end practice
Creating an Amazon clone for front-end practice involves replicating the user interface
and design of the Amazon website. It's a hands-on exercise where i mimic the layout,
navigation, and features to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This project
helps me to understand responsive design, user interactions, and the structure of ecommerce websites
